Robb Schuneman and I are pairing on an Eleventy site deployed to Netlify.
Robb is working on a new personal site. After some discussion in #accessibility, he decided move forward with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
He graciously agreed to stream the learning process for the benefit of others here.
It'll be fun! And you don't need any previous knowledge to learn with us.
